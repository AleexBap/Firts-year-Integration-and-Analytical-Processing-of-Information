# Abstract:
### Advances in multi-wavelength astronomical observations have revolutionized our understanding of astrophysical phenomena by combining data from space- and ground-based telescopes. This study presents a systematic analysis of observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the High Acuity Wide-field K-band Imager (HAWK-I), and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), leveraging their complementary capabilities to explore stellar, exoplanetary, and extragalactic systems.
### We develop a robust Python-based pipeline utilizing Astroquery for data retrieval, Astropy for coordinate transformations and unit management, Pandas for structured data processing, and NumPy for numerical computations.
### As a result of cross-matching observations across all four facilities (TESS, ALMA, HAWK-I, and JWST) and applying coordinate-based alignment criteria to target overlapping fields, we identified 10 high-probability coincident observation spots.
